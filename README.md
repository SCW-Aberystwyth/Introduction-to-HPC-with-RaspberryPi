Lessons on HPC for genomics lessons

Adapted from cloud-genomics repository

Where possible, HPC concepts and exercises are merged into the appropriate lesson.
This includes:
* variant calling workflow (wrangling-genomics)

Assumptions:
* First round, I will try to be as generic where possible, so that these lessons can work for multiple schedulers. We will, however, include site-specific info (login, filesystems, etc) to be removed later
* Where needed, commands will be specific to SLURM


To-do:
* Abstract materials where it makes sense. This can include using shell variables for places like SCRATCH, TEMP, WORKING_DIR, etc.
* Mark callouts for site-specific information (e.g. login hosts & filesystem names)
* Include similar commands for other schedulers
